<br>
Apply ANN in R or Python to the “IBM Employee Attrition V2” dataset in CANVAS to uncover the features that can predict employee attrition. This is a subset of a fictional data set created by IBM data scientists. Use every 5<sup>th</sup> record to create the test dataset and use the remaining records to create the training dataset. Do not normalize the data.

Hint:

(Use the “compute” function to score the test dataset

e.g  net.score &lt;- compute(your_ann, testdata))
